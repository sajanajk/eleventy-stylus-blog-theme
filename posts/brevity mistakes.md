Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said mistakes were made on all sides in the way Brexit was negotiated.

Mr Varadkar said he would be "flexible and reasonable" when attempting to solve issues with the Northern Ireland protocol.

He admitted that "perhaps" the treaty was a "little bit too strict" and that the European Union was willing to make compromises.

Mr Varadkar became PM, or taoiseach, for the second time last month.

The Fine Gael leader has been unpopular with some unionists who see him as instrumental in the creation of the contentious protocol.
