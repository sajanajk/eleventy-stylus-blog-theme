France is urging all European Union countries to start testing passengers arriving from China for COVID, amid an outbreak sweeping the Asian nation. 

So far the only EU countries to require testing are France, Italy and Spain -- plus the United Kingdom outside the bloc -- with EU officials failing to agree a common position at a meeting in Brussels before Christmas. 

More EU talks will take place this week. 

From Sunday, France is requiring that travellers from China provide a negative COVID-19 test result less than 48 hours before departure and will randomly test those arriving.

"France will push for this methodology to be applied across the EU," Health Minister François Braun said as he and Transport Minister Clement Beaune checked on the new procedures at Paris' Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport on Sunday.
