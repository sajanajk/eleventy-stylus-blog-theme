The leaders of Ukraine and Russia both vowed to push for victory in New Year speeches, but while Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke of gratitude and pain, Vladimir Putin urged duty to Russia, casting the war as a near-existential fight.

Zelenskyy, recalling some of the most dramatic moments and victories of the war, filled his emotional 17-minute video message with footage of Russia's attacks on the country and words of pride for Ukrainians withstanding attacks, darkness and cold.

"We were told: you have no other option but to surrender. We say: we have no other option than to win," said Zelenskyy, dressed in his trademark khaki outfit and standing in darkness with the Ukrainian flag fluttering behind.

"We fight as one team -- the whole country, all our regions. I admire you all."
