Pope Francis has led tributes to his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who has died, aged 95.

Benedict had been "noble" and "kind" - and "gifted" to the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope said.

US President Joe Biden and Brazilian President Lula are among dozens of leaders to praise the former pontiff.

Benedict resigned in 2013 because of poor health - the first pope to do so in 600 years. His funeral service will be held at the Vatican on 5 January.

The 265th leader of the Catholic Church, Benedict was a controversial figure. While some mourners hailed him resolute defender of the faith, others criticised his tenure for a failure to tackle allegations of the clerical sexual abuse.
