In the new year, Croatia will become the latest country to join the Eurozone and the Schengen area, a move that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen says makes the European Union stronger.

As of Sunday, the country will "join a community of 347 million Europeans who use the euro in their daily lives," von der Leyen said in a statement.

"This is a great achievement for Croatia. A symbol of its deep-rooted attachment to the EU, and a symbolic moment for the euro area as a whole."

She added: "It is a proud moment for the EU, Croatia and its citizens."

More than half of the countryâ€™s ATMs are offline to prepare them for dispensing the currency.
